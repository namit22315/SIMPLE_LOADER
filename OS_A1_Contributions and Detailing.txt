Description-
The program performs the task of a loader, which takes an executable file, in this case fib, made from the file fib.c, and loads it into the memory to be executed.
The loader cleanup function calls the free_elf_header and free_program_headers functions, which free the pointers for the elf header and program header respectively.
The load functions allocate memory to the elf and program headers respectively.
The map and run executable function declares our entry point, memory maps the segments, and then locates the entry point within the relevant segment.
The run entry point function typecasts the entry point and calls it, printing the value of the _start.
The load and run function opens the file descriptor and calls the load functions, the map and run function, and and the fucntion to close the file descriptor.
The main function calls the load and run function, and the loader cleanup function.
